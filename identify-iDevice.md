## Identify iDevice

The **Model Number** of an iDevice can be found here:

```
Settings -> General -> About -> Model Number
```

It shows one in `ML2I2KN/A` format (*detailed*), and on some models if you tap on it then another will appear - in `A1652` format (*general*). The *detailed* number is more useful as it provides information about memory and color too.

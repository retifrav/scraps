### Console

To open/show: `View` â†’ `Show Console`. This is a Python interactive console, so you can execute not only commands from Sublime Text plugins, but any other Python code (*bearing in mind that this is an embedded Python without your system packages installed from PyPI*).

#### Current Python version

``` py
import sys; sys.version
```

Once again, that is Sublime's embedded Python version, not your system one's.

Also, by right-clicking on input field you can switch between older and newer versions (*if your Sublime Text ships with more than one*).

#### Enable commands logging

``` py
sublime.log_commands(True)
```

Now any command you execute will be logged in the console output, so you can for example assign keybindings to them or inspect their arguments.

### Spellcheck dictionaries

To add more spellcheck languages, download dictionary files (*`*.aff`, `*.dic` and `*.txt`*) from <https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries>. I am often working with texts that contain two languages - russian and english - so it was really useful to get a "combined" dictionary for both of those.

To install downloaded dictionary, launch `Preferences: Browse Packages` from Command Palette, and place them into a new folder named `Language - Russian-English`, so you get this:

``` sh
$ pwd
/e/programs/sublime-text/Data/Packages

$ ls -L1 ./"Language - Russian-English"/
Russian-English.aff
Russian-English.dic
Russian-English.txt
```

No need to restart Sublime Text, new dictionary is already available for selection.

### Plugins API

#### Run a plugin command

If a plugin has a View command named `ExampleCommand`, you can call it from console:

``` py
view.run_command("example")
```

or if it's a Window command, then:

``` py
window.run_command("example")
```

#### General information

Available at any time:

``` py
sublime.version()
sublime.channel()
sublime.platform()
sublime.arch()
```

Available only after the `plugin_host` and plugins are loaded (*so you will need to call these from `plugin_loaded()` of your plugin*):

``` py
sublime.packages_path()
sublime.installed_packages_path()
```

#### Open a file via GUI dialog

The callback function is the same for all variants:

``` py
def openSomeFile(
        window: sublime.Window,
        selectedFile: str
        ) -> None:
    #print(f"Total views: {len(window.views())}")
    #print(f"Is file already open: {window.find_open_file(selectedFile)}")
    if selectedFile:
        try:
            window.open_file(
                selectedFile
            )
        except Exception as ex:
            print(f"error: {ex}")
            sublime.error_message(
                " ".join((
                    "There was an error trying to open the file.",
                    "Check console for details."
                ))
            )
            return
```

But note that only the variant with [double lambda](#using-double-lambda) provides correctly working access to `window` properties and methods, such as `views()` and `find_open_file()` (<https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/5382>).

##### Using lambda

``` py
class OpenSomeFileCommand(sublime_plugin.WindowCommand):
    def run(self):
        originalFile: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path(
            self.window.active_view().file_name()
        )

        sublime.open_dialog(
            lambda f: openSomeFile(
                self.window,
                f
            ),
            [],
            str(originalFile.parents[0]),
            False,
            False
        )
```

##### Using functools.partial

``` py
class OpenSomeFileCommand(sublime_plugin.WindowCommand):
    def run(self):
        originalFile: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path(
            self.window.active_view().file_name()
        )

        f = functools.partial(openSomeFile, self.window)

        sublime.open_dialog(
            f,
            [],
            str(originalFile.parents[0]),
            False,
            False
        )
```

##### Using double lambda

``` py
class OpenSomeFileCommand(sublime_plugin.WindowCommand):
    def run(self):
        originalFile: pathlib.Path = pathlib.Path(
            self.window.active_view().file_name()
        )

        sublime.open_dialog(
            lambda f: sublime.set_timeout(
                lambda: openSomeFile(
                    self.window,
                    f
                )
            ),
            [],
            str(originalFile.parents[0]),
            False,
            False
        )
```

#### Scroll to a line

If you have the region:

``` py
def scrollToProblematicLine(
    view: sublime.View,
    region: sublime.Region
) -> None:
    lineSelection = view.sel()
    lineSelection.clear()
    lineSelection.add(region)
    view.show(region)
```

If you don't have the region, but have the line number:

``` py
def scrollToProblematicLineNumber(
    view: sublime.View,
    lineNumber: int
) -> None:
    pnt: int = view.text_point(lineNumber, 0)
    lineRegion: sublime.Region = view.line(pnt)
    scrollToProblematicLine(view, lineRegion)
```

#### Put some content to a new tab/view

For instance, if you want to show some results to a user:

``` py
class SomethingWithResultsCommand(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):
    def run(self, edit):
        # for simplicity, let's just take current file contents
        bf = self.view.substr(sublime.Region(0, self.view.size()))
        # create a new tab/view
        nf = self.view.window().new_file()
        # put the results there
        nf.insert(edit, 0, bf)
```
